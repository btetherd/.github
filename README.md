btetherd local dating app.

# Introduction
With this app, we are trying to facilitate meeting new potential partners in clubs/bars/places where many humans hang around and have fun. Online dating became extremely mechanical, most matches do not end up in any dialogue between two sides, not to mention actual face to face meetings. People often tend to use the apps for a quick self-worth boost, without actually using it for it's purpose - meeting others. We wanted to overcome these obstacles by creating an app that does not dehumanizes us, humans, but enables us to tackle the fear of making the first step, without the unnecessary hassle of trying to act cool over online chats, we want to enforce direct contact between matches. Our goal is also to give power back to women. With the huge disproportion of men on online dating apps, whose sole goal is often to send a picture of their aubergines, we want women to make the choice whether they want to be approached or not.

# Description
btetherd will be a local-area, approach-encouraging, dating app with women having the decisive hand. To explain the idea in a more graphical way, let's tell a story of John:

John is a 21-year old college student, his major is mechanical engineering. John is not the boldest type, he never had the courage to come up to random women to introduce himself, especially the ones he finds attractive. It's friday night, so in a typical student fashion, John and his colleagues are planning to hit a local bar for a couple of beers and some good old fun. They hit the bar, get a table and order beer. Life is good. Suddenly, John's eye is hooked onto a newcomer. A dark-blonde hair, blue eyed hottie passing by their table with some friends. John is star-struck and paralyzed at the same time. Star-struck because he has never seen a queen like this before, paralyzed because the mere thought of approaching his soon-to-be girlfriend (in what to John's line of thought was an alternate universe). After telling the boys about the new revelation and their happily ever after, John quickly grabs his iPhone. He quickly recollects an app his hotshot cousin Dominik told him about:

"Bro, have you heard of this new dating app? It's called btetherd. It's freaking genius my dude. Listen - you make a profile, upload some hot photo of yourself, pass basic details, but keep it classy man, don't mention the D size, surprise them later ðŸ˜‰. And enable Bluetooth for the app, which is also cool, because they don't use the phones location data, keeping it low-key my man. And that's it. Now, you hit up a club or some other fun-oriented place. Here's the catch, women make the decision, you can't just start right-swiping everything that moves; your profile is visible to surrounding women and they can make the call if they want to be approached or not, so you can just chill and wait for wonders to happen. When they tap the "Approach" button on your profile, you get notified and it's up to you what you wanna do. You gotta try it out my dude! Once you get that notification it gives you a morale boost to hit it off that I never had. Try it yourself!" - John remembered his cousin's wise words.

*"Maybe she's on btetherd?"* - John thought to himself.

He went to the AppStore and started typing with a pace he never typed before. Found it, downloaded. He took a photo of him with the boys so his potential target could easily recognize him. Enable Bluetooth notification and boom, we are done. Now it's waiting time. The girl was sitting across the bar, quite far, but close enough for John to be able to observe her. She was chit-chatting with her female friends, laughing and smiling, occasionally giving John a quick glance, which encouraged him even more. Eventually, she grabbed her phone.

*"Now or never"* - John whispered.

She seemed to be looking at the phone and taking quick looks around. John, with his palms sweaty, no vommit on sweater yet, watching the empty feed and dragging the top of it to refresh. He was (creepily at this point I might add) watching her every action. She hid her phone. 

*"It is over"* - he whispered again, with desperation in his thoughts. - *"I will never cold-approach her, she will surely reject me."* - he added.

Like a lightning from the sky, a notification arrived. He grabs the phone with shaky hands, almost dropping it to the ground. It's a notification from btetherd. 

*"It's go time! Agniecha gave you a green light!"* - the notification says.

His sweaty finger lands on the notification view. The app opens. John cannot believe what is happening, his head feels a bit dizzy. He takes a look onto the photo to verify if Agniecha is the girl of his dreams (for the night). To his surprise, it's the one and only dark blonde hair, blue eyed she-devil that he was gazing at past the last 30 minutes. She passed him a look and smirked slightly. John almost fell off the chair while trying to keep it cool and sent back a smirk of his own which, to anyone but himself, looked more like he was missing a chromosome or two. He quickly downed the remaining beer, told the boys to wish him luck and aimed straight for the target. 

... Aaand then they were living happily ever after.

**PS** John & Agniecha hooked up that night, but they quickly realized they aren't meant for each other. A year later, John found out she was dating his hot-shot cousin Dominik. 

**THE END**
